This memo defines a brief set of tests to determine the decapsulation behaviour of an unknown remote tunnel endpoint with respect to the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) field in the Internet Protocol (IP) header. The tests could be automated to be used by a tunnel ingress to determine whether the egress that it is paired with will propagate ECN correctly.
